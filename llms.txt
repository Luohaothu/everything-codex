# everything-codex

> A comprehensive configuration toolkit for OpenAI Codex CLI.

## Project Structure

- `AGENTS.md` -- repository-wide operating rules and coding standards
- `config.toml` -- Codex CLI configuration with profiles and MCP servers
- `skills/` -- 61 reusable skills (workflow definitions + domain knowledge)
- `workflows/` -- execution playbooks combining skills into end-to-end processes
- `prompts/` -- fill-in-the-blank templates for consistent outputs
- `rules/` -- Starlark execution policies + language-specific markdown rules
- `golang/` / `python/` / `typescript/` -- language-specific AGENTS.md templates
- `scripts/install.sh` -- installer with backup, merge strategies, and manifest tracking
- `scripts/uninstall.sh` -- manifest-based uninstall with rollback support

## Key Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/plan` | Implementation planning with risk assessment |
| `/tdd` | Test-driven development (RED/GREEN/REFACTOR) |
| `/code-review` | Quality, security, and maintainability review |
| `/security-review` | Vulnerability analysis and OWASP checklist |
| `/verify` | Build/lint/test/security verification loop |
| `/orchestrate` | Sequential skill workflow for full features |
| `/architect` | System design and architectural review |
| `/build-fix` | Fix build errors with minimal diffs |

## Key Commands

```bash
# Install
./scripts/install.sh

# Validate structure and skills
npm run validate

# Run tests
npm test

# Lint
npm run lint
```

## Workflows

Workflows are higher-level playbooks in `workflows/`:
- `plan.md` -- structured planning process
- `tdd.md` -- test-driven development cycle
- `code-review.md` -- review process with severity levels
- `orchestrate.md` -- end-to-end feature workflow
- `refactor-clean.md` -- safe dead-code removal
- `verify.md` -- pre-commit and pre-PR verification gate

## Non-Goals

- No Claude Code plugin integration
- No OpenCode integration
- No compatibility layer for legacy agent ecosystems
